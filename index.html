      My name is Ben Petrila. I was born in 1988 in Denver, CO. I attended East
      High School where I played soccer and rugby. I still love to watch rugby
      with my wife. We also enjoy playing card and board games. I then went to
      Knox College where I majored in History and received a minor in religious
       studies. After College became a Tier 1 Help Desk agent for GDIT. I have
       since moved on to become a Tier 2 service desk agent for CH2MHILL. I
       enjoy solving problems to help users obtain the best experience.

        I have always enjoyed exploring technology and the products you are
        able to create through technology. I love getting my hands on new
        software or tools and messing around with them. The creation part of
        coding is super interesting to me. Itâ€™s satisfying to see something
        that you created from nothing come to life. I am excited to keep
        learning and adding more tools to my toolbox and increase my skills
        in website creation.
